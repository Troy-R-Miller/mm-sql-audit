# Maven Movies Audit with SQL

Overview: 

This project contains a series of structured SQL queries used to perform a business audit of the fictional Maven Movies rental database. The company's insurance policy is up for renewal, and new information is required for an updated policy. The audit focuses on staff, inventory, customer activity, replacement costs, and payment processing to provide insights for policy updates. As the Analyst, I was taked with extracting the required information using targeted queries and return the results to the stakeholders. 

Objectives: 

Extract requested data to support the company's new insurance policy. The following data has been requested for analyis: 

1. Staff information
2. Inventory distribution
3. Active customers per store
4. Customer email count
5. Unique films and categories
6. Replacement cost metrics
7. Payment transaction statistics
8. Customer rental behavior

Key Insights: 

The queries returned data useful for both the insurance company and Maven Movies. Durng the audit process, we identified our most loyal customers, while developing a better understanding about which store our customers are most active at. These insights have allowed us to implement a strong customer loyalty program, and develop a campaign to attract more customers to the lesser visited location. 

Our total customer distribution can be seen below:
